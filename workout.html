            <h3>Targeting Areas</h3>
            <p>
                When working out you can really customize your workouts with things you love that may include just going for a walk and/or run, swimming, biking, hiking, and more!
            </p>
                I personally love going to the gym to work on making myself fit and stronger! When working out with weights you can really focus on specific muscle groups in your workout that you want to work on and make stronger. These muscle groups include:
            <p>
                
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Biceps</li>
                <li>Back</li>
                <li>Quads</li>
                <li>Glutes</li>
                <li>And much more!</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Weekly routine</h3>
            <p>
               Having a routine prepped and ready for the week with your weekly workouts is a good step to take to stay motivated. Having your days planned to specifc muscle groups and workouts can help with simlify working out at the gym when you get there so you don't have wonder what to do or worry about thinking of workouts on the spot! Here is an example of a weekly routine that you could follow:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sunday: Rest day!</li>
                <li>Monday: Upper body/push day</li>
                <li>Tuesday: Glutes and hamstrings</li>
                <li>Wednesday: Abs/Cardio or Rest day</li>
                <li>Thursday: Upper body/ pull day</li>
                <li>Friday: Lower body day</li>
                <li>Saturday: Full body or Rest day</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This will vary on how often you exercise and what your goals are!
