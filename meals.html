            <h3>Different "Diets"</h3>
            <p>
                I don't usually like using the word diet when it comes to eating healthy because people usually think of "restrictions" when they hear diet and think they won't enjoy the food because it's healthy and boring which does not have to be the case! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Having a consistent diet and eating cleaner is an important part of the fitness and healthy lifestyle process and can look different for everyone! Some different diets may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Being Vegetarian</li>
                <li>Being Vegan</li>
                <li>Keto</li>
                <li>No dairy</li>
                <li>And much more!</li>

            </ul>
